# CMS

Technical requirements:
 Deep Modularity: the architecture of the system should be based on a modular principle. WordPress is
an example of a CMS made entirely from modules, which are assembled together to support flexibility
and extensibility of the mechanism. Distribution of tasks and responsibilities amongst multiple modules
allows easy maintenance and makes process of developing extensions (plugins) for the system simple,
as modules can be used, updated and replaced independently without affecting the whole mechanism.
 Front-end editor: from the background research it was noted that drag&drop functionality is the key
factor which leans people towards website builders than towards rather complicated CM systems. As
evident from the primary research, most of the survey respondents have marked an “Ease of use” as the
most important quality a CMS. Over 73% of respondents have stated that they see a front-end editor as
the most comfortable tool to manipulate page templates.
 Template support: support of templating is a feature all the researched systems have in common. Also
it has been upheld by the target audience that variety of pre-defined styles is an important aspect.
 Template changes: system must allow template change at any time (Wix suffers inability to change
template once site is live).
 Themes: themes are essential since, as research has shown, people come to use CMSs because they are
mainly looking for out-of-the-box solution.
 Push CM & Project exports: developer communities have recognised the “renaissance” of static
websites as a new trend. Squarespace and Weebly are known for excellent search engines indexing due
to the use of static pages. Separation of CMS and the website is a crucial factor to website load time and
good SEO. Moreover, it reduces code redundancy.
 Thin client[9]: all the popular system tend to use web browsers as thin clients, as this is more convenient
to most of the users.
 Taxonomy: outstanding taxonomy system is what has made Drupal the leading CMS in development of
websites with complicated data structures.
 Access Control: one of the weak spots of Joomla!. Access and permissions management is an important
aspect of system security.
 Manual code editing: 32.3% of survey respondents would like to have advanced functionality.
WordPress is often criticised for its restricted functionality. Code editing allows greater flexibility in
website customisation for the technically-skilled users.
 Meta-info management and URL manipulations: another aspect of SEO, which is present in every
researched CMS. On the scale of importance from 1 to 5, 32 people interviewed (94%) rated SEO with
the score of 3 or higher.
 Back-ups: hard to underestimate the importance of preserving data and progress.
 SPAs and PWAs: the system must be capable of producing SPAs and PWAs to accommodate trends in
web development and have a competitive advantage in the market.
